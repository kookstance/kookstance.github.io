Hey there, I'm Kevin. I'm a chemical neuroscientist at UC Berkeley studying the molecular basis of neurodegenerative diseases using small molecules. I'm currently an NIH postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of [Richard Kramer](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/kramerlab/home) where I use functionalized azobenzene photoswitches to restore light sensitivity to neurons in the blind eye. 

I did my PhD in chemistry with [Jerry Yang](http://yanglab.ucsd.edu/index.html) at UC San Diego where I designed and synthesized fluorescent dyes that could detect and identify different types of amyloids and prions in brain tissue. During my undergraduate studies (also at UCSD), I worked with [Bruce Hamilton](https://medschool.ucsd.edu/som/cmm/research/labs/hamilton/Pages/default.aspx) characterizing developmental phenotypes in a transcription factor knock-out mouse. 

Outside of research, you can find me in the surf along the coast of California.
